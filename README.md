# Deprecation
This browser extension is now deprecated after the many changes to Twitter in the past year. 

# Less Annoying Twitter

## Abstract
This browser extension hides the Twitter login bar shown to logged out users at the bottom of the page.

## Tech Stack
This project uses vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML.

## Setup/Installation
You can clone the repo locally using `git clone`.

[This article](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked) offers detailed instructions on loading an unpacked chrome extension. You can navigate to the chrome extensions page via the puzzle piece icon in the toolbar. After enabling developer mode, you can click "load unpacked extension" and choose the folder via the popup. You should then see the recycle icon appear in the toolbar. When you click on it, you can see "Less Annoying Twitter." If you navigate to `twitter.com`, you should no longer be prompted to sign in with the blur bar along the bottom of the page.

## Preview




## Next Steps
Long term, it would be great to bypass required login for trending topics on twitter.
